Thhis is a very rough and simple project that I created for fun. 
It is by no means a professional or polished application, and this will work anywhere as long as you have the dependencies installed. 
However, I hope that it can be a useful starting point for anyone interested in learning about web development, PDF parsing, and data extraction. Please feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and experiment with the code to make it your own.

Here is the Directory:

.
├── app.py
├── static
│   └── style.css
└── templates

Packages used:

Flask (for web framework)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
PyPDF4 (for PDF text extraction)
NLTK (for natural language processing)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
